Test charge.py:

 We need to mock some "secrets" in our
 environment. 
 
    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ = {"CREDIT_CARD": "4444 4444 4444 4444"}
    >>> CREDIT_CARD = os.environ["CREDIT_CARD"]

Import charge to test charge_card function:
    >>> import charge
    Charged 100 to 4444 4444 4444 4444


Test greet.py:

Since this is interactive, let's have a fake input handler:

    >>> import sys
    >>> def fake_input(prompt):
    ...     sys.stdout.write(prompt)
    ...     v = _inputs.pop(0)
    ...     print(v)
    ...     return v

    >>> try:
    ...     import __builtin__ as b    # Python 2
    ... except ImportError:
    ...     import builtins as b       # Python 3

    >>> b.raw_input = b.input = fake_input

Making a fake answer:

    >>> _inputs = ["Balloonicorn", "Unicorn"]

    >>> import greet
    First Name? Balloonicorn
    Last Name? Unicorn
    Hi Balloonicorn Unicorn
