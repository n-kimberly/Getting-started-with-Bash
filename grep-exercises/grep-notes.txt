helpful options
-c to return count
-n to display line numbers
-v invert matching:
-E extended grep

helpful patterns
\|$ to display full body, leaving matches highlighted
^ at beginning, to look for matches at beg of line, just like in vim normal mode
$ at end, to look for matches at end of line, just like in vim normal mode

helpful notes
() back reference: i.e. '\([0-9]\)\1' <- look for duplicate numbers
no need to escape if -E
